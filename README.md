# unnmaed hue lights sync mod

## ideas:
- based on biome
- based on light level (block light, especially at night)
- based on sky access/skylight (cave detection?)
- based on time cycle
- based on sky darkness (thunderstorms, rain, and lightning!)
- APPLY CORRECTION BASED ON LIGHTSSS

## but wait:
i might have to reimplement everything to use entertainment zones if they use a special stream thing to make performance or latency better, although i need to research
