# McHue
A Minecraft mod that attempts to sync your lights with the game context.

## WARNING:
This is still heavily work in progress and the lights might not match the surroundings well.
Many things are also hardcoded as an interface to configure them is not ready yet, but work is being made in my free time.

## [notepad for the developer]:
- based on biome
- based on lighting conditions
- CAVE DETECTION
- based on sky darkness (thunderstorms, rain, and lightning!)
- based on night vision lol
- i might have to reimplement everything to use entertainment zones if they use a special stream thing to make performance or latency better, although i need to research
